title: "Waterloo Co-op Series Part 3: Choosing Where to Apply"
---
+ Don't wait until the last day to apply to jobs
  + My friend made this mistake, and then realized he was off by one day. He was
      not able to apply to any jobs and had to return to his last co-op.
+ Maintain a 35/10/5 ratio when applying to the 50 jobs
  + 35 should be low-risk, jobs where you're pretty confident you could get an
      offer
  + 10 should be medium-risk, jobs where you might get an offer, you might not
  + 5 should be high-risk, jobs where you likely won't get an offer
+ Don't apply to any job where you know you won't accept the offer
  + Your "safety jobs" should still be somewhere you could see yourself working
+ Don't focus too much on the money, but also keep in mind that money is a proxy
  for how much they care about their interns. For example, the Social+Capital
  portfolio of companies pays their Waterloo interns a lot, and they also have a
  great internship program. The founder of Social+Capital is a Waterloo grad.
+ Don't save your applications for the second round. Use them all up in the
  first round. The jobs are generally better.
