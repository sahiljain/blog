    <p>I started the year at 171lbs, and 7 months later I’m now at 144lbs. I’ve lost
27lbs in 29 weeks, which means I’ve lost around 1lb/week. I’ve learned a lot
about diet and exercise, and I wanted to document all the diet strategies I’ve
learned.</p>

<h1 id="my-motivation-to-lose-weight">My Motivation to Lose Weight</h1>

<p>My only motivation to lose weight is for the aesthetic of it. I want to be proud
of my physique, and view myself as someone who works out and takes care of his
appearance. I’ve gained and lost weight in the past, but I’ve never been at a 
very low body fat percentage.</p>

<h1 id="step-1-counting-calories-and-macronutrient-intake">Step 1: Counting Calories and Macronutrient Intake</h1>

<p>The first step for me was to get a sense of how many calories I eat in a day
without trying to lose weight. I logged everything I ate through MyFitnessPal
and I learned that certain foods were more caloric than I expected (bread,
pasta, etc) and certain foods were less caloric (fruits and vegetables). This
also got me in the habit of tracking what I eat and paying attention to portion
sizes.</p>

<p>The second step for me was to determine my Total Daily Energy Expenditure using
a calculator (<a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">this one for example</a>). For my
weight and height, my TDEE at the time was 2400 calories. This roughly lined up
with the calorie intake I measured using MyFitnessPal.</p>

<p>The third step was to come up with a calorie goal and a macronutrient goal. A
pound of fat generally stores 3500 calories, so it takes a daily 500 calorie
deficit to lose 1lb per week. From the previous step, my TDEE was 2400 calories,
so my goal was to eat less than 1900 calories. For macronutrients, a gram of
protein contains 4 calories of energy, a gram of carbs contains 4 calories, and
a gram of fat contains 9 calories. It’s a good idea to eat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkIKesKHIIE&amp;t=50s">1 gram of protein per
pound of lean body mass</a>, and to
eat a minimum of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLGEDf9Ugi0">0.3 grams of fat per pound of body
weight</a> to maintain hormone
function. This puts my macronutrient goal at ~140 grams of protein, ~50 grams of
fat, and ~220 grams of carbs. The most important goal is the calories, next is
the protein, and the breakdown of carbs vs fat doesn’t matter too much as long
as I’m eating a minimum of 50 grams of fat.</p>

<p>Beware that losing weight faster than 1lb/week increases the risk of rebounding,
since your body has less time to adapt to your new weight, and your diet is
likely harder to sustain.</p>

<h1 id="step-2-getting-enough-protein-without-eating-too-many-calories">Step 2: Getting Enough Protein Without Eating Too Many Calories</h1>

<p>It’s tough getting adequate protein as a vegetarian, and it’s even harder to be
in a caloric deficit at the same time. It takes a lot of planning, shopping, and
cooking to come up with meals that will give me enough protein without excess
carbs and fat. Lentils and chickpeas have too many carbs, Impossible burgers are
too fatty, and protein powder tastes bad and isn’t satiating. My rule of thumb
is that a meal is good if the ratio of proteins to calories is 1:12 or better.
Here are some meal options that have worked for me:</p>

<h1 id="step-3-managing-hunger">Step 3: Managing Hunger</h1>

<p>To feel fuller, we want to optimize for food that’s as filling as possible per
calorie. In descending order of satiety to calorie, we should have more water,
fibre, and protein. For example, have more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water (diet sodas, calorie-free drinks)</li>
  <li>Fibre (popcorn, seaweed snack, vegetables, fruit)</li>
  <li>Protein (whey protein, pea protein, soy protein)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the opposite end, here are the least filling foods in order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sugar (candy, baked goods)</li>
  <li>Low-fibre carbs (rice, white bread)</li>
  <li>Fat (french fries, whip cream)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are certain foods known to suppress grehlin, the hunger hormone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Caffeine</li>
  <li>Watermelon</li>
  <li>Omega 3 fatty acids (algae oil supplement)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other strategies to reduce hunger are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get enough sleep</li>
  <li>Delay your first meal as much as possible, and stop eating 2-3 hours before
sleeping</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="step-4-managing-cravings">Step 4: Managing Cravings</h1>

<p>Sometimes (many times per week) I’ll want food that doesn’t fit my
protein-to-calorie ratio requirement, like desserts and fast food. Instead of
cutting these foods out, I like to find a close alternative that fits my macros
better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peanut butter and Nutella sandwich
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the peanut butter with <a href="https://pbfit.com/">PB Fit</a></li>
      <li>Replace the bread with <a href="https://ketoculturebaking.com/pages/bread">Keto Bread</a> or <a href="https://www.safeway.com/shop/product-details.960539903.html">Egg White Wraps</a></li>
      <li>Replace the Nutella with <a href="https://www.waldenfarms.com/product/zero-calorie-chocolate-syrup/">calorie-free chocolate
  sauce</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ice cream
    <ul>
      <li>Have greek yogurt with berries and 0cal maple syrup instead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an alternative food is not possible, have the food you’re craving but eat
some protein alongside it. If you’re craving chocolate, crush it and mix it into
greek yogurt. If you’re craving french fries, have it with 0cal ketchup and a
protein shake.</p>

<h1 id="step-5-maintaining-a-high-metabolism">Step 5: Maintaining a High Metabolism</h1>
<p>It’s a myth that being in a caloric deficit will put you in starvation mode, and
that your metabolism will drop to the point where you’re no longer in a deficit.
While this isn’t true, there are a few ways your metabolism decreases while
dieting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less food leads to more lethargy, so you move around less and burn less
calories</li>
  <li>Losing weight directly reduces your energy expenditure</li>
  <li>Your digestive system burns energy to digest food, and eating less means
burning less energy</li>
</ul>

<p>To counteract these, try:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Counting your steps and walking a minimum of 10k steps</li>
  <li>Adapt your calorie goals to your new weight every month</li>
  <li>Eat a lot of fibre and protein to keep your digestive system active</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="step-5-adapting-my-goals">Step 5: Adapting my Goals</h1>

<p>As you lose weight, your metabolism will decrease as you have less tissue to
maintain and provide energy to. You should adapt your TDEE calculation for every
few pounds that you lose in order to maintain a regular loss rate of 1lb/week.
As you get leaner, protein will become more and more important to maintain
muscle, so consider increasing the amount of protein while decreasing the amount
of calories. Currently I’m aiming for 150g of protein and 1700cal per day.</p>

<h1 id="what-ive-gained-from-losing-weight">What I’ve Gained from Losing Weight</h1>

<p>I thought that losing weight would give me more energy, but it’s drained way
more energy than it’s given me. Consistenly being in a caloric deficit is tough
mentally (I have to manage my hunger, forego food that I want for food that fits
my macros, etc) and physically (makes it tougher to recover from weightlifting,
harder to sleep).</p>

<p>I feel better about my physique than I ever have, and I’m even more motivated to
continue bodybuilding. Even though most diets fail and have a rebound, I’m
confident I can keep the fat off by intuitively eating, monitoring my weight,
and counting calories once in a while so I get a sense of what my daily caloric
intake is.</p>
