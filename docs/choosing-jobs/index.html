<meta name="description" content="Don’t wait until the last day to apply to jobs My friend made this mistake, and then realized he was off by one day. He was not able to apply to any jobs and had to return to his last co-op. Maintain a 35/10/5 ratio when applying to the 50 jobs 35 should be low-risk, jobs where you’re pretty confident you could get an offer 10 should be medium-risk, jobs where you might get an offer, you might not 5 should be high-risk, jobs where you likely won’t get an offer Don’t apply to any job where you know you won’t accept the offer Your “safety jobs” should still be somewhere you could see yourself working Don’t focus too much on the money, but also keep in mind that money is a proxy for how much they care about their interns. For example, the Social+Capital portfolio of companies pays their Waterloo interns a lot, and they also have a great internship program. The founder of Social+Capital is a Waterloo grad. Don’t save your applications for the second round. Use them all up in the first round. The jobs are generally better." />
