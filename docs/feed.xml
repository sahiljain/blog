I’ve lost
27lbs in 29 weeks, which means I’ve lost around 1lb/week. I’ve learned a lot
about diet and exercise, and I wanted to document all the diet strategies I’ve
learned.</p>

<h1 id="my-motivation-to-lose-weight">My Motivation to Lose Weight</h1>

<p>My only motivation to lose weight is for the aesthetic of it. I want to be proud
of my physique, and view myself as someone who works out and takes care of his
appearance. I’ve gained and lost weight in the past, but I’ve never been at a 
very low body fat percentage.</p>

<h1 id="step-1-counting-calories-and-macronutrient-intake">Step 1: Counting Calories and Macronutrient Intake</h1>

<p>The first step for me was to get a sense of how many calories I eat in a day
without trying to lose weight. I logged everything I ate through MyFitnessPal
and I learned that certain foods were more caloric than I expected (bread,
pasta, etc) and certain foods were less caloric (fruits and vegetables). This
also got me in the habit of tracking what I eat and paying attention to portion
sizes.</p>

<p>The second step for me was to determine my Total Daily Energy Expenditure using
a calculator (<a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">this one for example</a>). For my
weight and height, my TDEE at the time was 2400 calories. This roughly lined up
with the calorie intake I measured using MyFitnessPal.</p>

<p>The third step was to come up with a calorie goal and a macronutrient goal. A
pound of fat generally stores 3500 calories, so it takes a daily 500 calorie
deficit to lose 1lb per week. From the previous step, my TDEE was 2400 calories,
so my goal was to eat less than 1900 calories. For macronutrients, a gram of
protein contains 4 calories of energy, a gram of carbs contains 4 calories, and
a gram of fat contains 9 calories. It’s a good idea to eat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkIKesKHIIE&amp;t=50s">1 gram of protein per
pound of lean body mass</a>, and to
eat a minimum of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLGEDf9Ugi0">0.3 grams of fat per pound of body
weight</a> to maintain hormone
function. This puts my macronutrient goal at ~140 grams of protein, ~50 grams of
fat, and ~220 grams of carbs. The most important goal is the calories, next is
the protein, and the breakdown of carbs vs fat doesn’t matter too much as long
as I’m eating a minimum of 50 grams of fat.</p>

<p>Beware that losing weight faster than 1lb/week increases the risk of rebounding,
since your body has less time to adapt to your new weight, and your diet is
likely harder to sustain.</p>

<h1 id="step-2-getting-enough-protein-without-eating-too-many-calories">Step 2: Getting Enough Protein Without Eating Too Many Calories</h1>

<p>It’s tough getting adequate protein as a vegetarian, and it’s even harder to be
in a caloric deficit at the same time. It takes a lot of planning, shopping, and
cooking to come up with meals that will give me enough protein without excess
carbs and fat. Lentils and chickpeas have too many carbs, Impossible burgers are
too fatty, and protein powder tastes bad and isn’t satiating. My rule of thumb
is that a meal is good if the ratio of proteins to calories is 1:12 or better.
Here are some meal options that have worked for me:</p>

<h1 id="step-3-managing-hunger">Step 3: Managing Hunger</h1>

<p>To feel fuller, we want to optimize for food that’s as filling as possible per
calorie. In descending order of satiety to calorie, we should have more water,
fibre, and protein. For example, have more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water (diet sodas, calorie-free drinks)</li>
  <li>Fibre (popcorn, seaweed snack, vegetables, fruit)</li>
  <li>Protein (whey protein, pea protein, soy protein)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the opposite end, here are the least filling foods in order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sugar (candy, baked goods)</li>
  <li>Low-fibre carbs (rice, white bread)</li>
  <li>Fat (french fries, whip cream)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are certain foods known to suppress grehlin, the hunger hormone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Caffeine</li>
  <li>Watermelon</li>
  <li>Omega 3 fatty acids (algae oil supplement)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other strategies to reduce hunger are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get enough sleep</li>
  <li>Delay your first meal as much as possible, and stop eating 2-3 hours before
sleeping</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="step-4-managing-cravings">Step 4: Managing Cravings</h1>

<p>Sometimes (many times per week) I’ll want food that doesn’t fit my
protein-to-calorie ratio requirement, like desserts and fast food. Instead of
cutting these foods out, I like to find a close alternative that fits my macros
better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peanut butter and Nutella sandwich
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the peanut butter with <a href="https://pbfit.com/">PB Fit</a></li>
      <li>Replace the bread with <a href="https://ketoculturebaking.com/pages/bread">Keto Bread</a> or <a href="https://www.safeway.com/shop/product-details.960539903.html">Egg White Wraps</a></li>
      <li>Replace the Nutella with <a href="https://www.waldenfarms.com/product/zero-calorie-chocolate-syrup/">calorie-free chocolate
  sauce</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ice cream
    <ul>
      <li>Have greek yogurt with berries and 0cal maple syrup instead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an alternative food is not possible, have the food you’re craving but eat
some protein alongside it. If you’re craving chocolate, crush it and mix it into
greek yogurt. If you’re craving french fries, have it with 0cal ketchup and a
protein shake.</p>

<h1 id="step-5-maintaining-a-high-metabolism">Step 5: Maintaining a High Metabolism</h1>
<p>It’s a myth that being in a caloric deficit will put you in starvation mode, and
that your metabolism will drop to the point where you’re no longer in a deficit.
While this isn’t true, there are a few ways your metabolism decreases while
dieting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less food leads to more lethargy, so you move around less and burn less
calories</li>
  <li>Losing weight directly reduces your energy expenditure</li>
  <li>Your digestive system burns energy to digest food, and eating less means
burning less energy</li>
</ul>

<p>To counteract these, try:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Counting your steps and walking a minimum of 10k steps</li>
  <li>Adapt your calorie goals to your new weight every month</li>
  <li>Eat a lot of fibre and protein to keep your digestive system active</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="step-5-adapting-my-goals">Step 5: Adapting my Goals</h1>

<p>As you lose weight, your metabolism will decrease as you have less tissue to
maintain and provide energy to. You should adapt your TDEE calculation for every
few pounds that you lose in order to maintain a regular loss rate of 1lb/week.
As you get leaner, protein will become more and more important to maintain
muscle, so consider increasing the amount of protein while decreasing the amount
of calories. Currently I’m aiming for 150g of protein and 1700cal per day.</p>

<h1 id="what-ive-gained-from-losing-weight">What I’ve Gained from Losing Weight</h1>

<p>I thought that losing weight would give me more energy, but it’s drained way
more energy than it’s given me. Consistenly being in a caloric deficit is tough
mentally (I have to manage my hunger, forego food that I want for food that fits
my macros, etc) and physically (makes it tougher to recover from weightlifting,
harder to sleep).</p>

<p>I feel better about my physique than I ever have, and I’m even more motivated to
continue bodybuilding. Even though most diets fail and have a rebound, I’m
confident I can keep the fat off by intuitively eating, monitoring my weight,
and counting calories once in a while so I get a sense of what my daily caloric
intake is.</p>

I had 6
internships, and had to interview for 5 of them. Through these many interviews,
I found a pattern in the interview structure, what they wanted to hear, and how
people studied for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-interview-structure">The Interview Structure</h2>

<p>Interviews are weird. They’re very formulaic, but fortunately this makes them
easy to prepare for. The interviewer is not trying to get to know you
personally. The interview is simply a time to gather certain signals about you,
and relay those signals to those in charge of hiring. The structure looks like
this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intro</li>
  <li>(optional) behavioral question</li>
  <li>technical question</li>
  <li>technical question follow-up</li>
  <li>time for you to ask questions</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-intro">The Intro</h1>

<p>The interview starts with the interviewer introducing themselves, describing the
company, and asking you if you need to use the bathroom before the interview
starts. The purpose of the intro is to calm you down. Save any questions you
have for the end, to leave as much time as possible for the actual interview.
Often I will be asked the classic “tell me about yourself”. Be concise with
this. The interviewer is probably not going to care about your answer, and is just
asking you in order to calm you down. The interview will be focused on
the technical question. Don’t try to impress them by telling, impress them by
showing.</p>

<h1 id="the-rarely-asked-behavioral-question">The (Rarely Asked) Behavioral Question</h1>

<p>I rarely get asked a non-technical question during an interview, but if I do, it
is usually “tell me about a challenge you faced recently and how you overcame
it”. I have no advice for you here, other than to prepare the answer
beforehand.</p>

<h1 id="the-technical-question">The Technical Question</h1>

<p>The interviewer doesn’t care if you solve the question or not. They are simply
looking to gather certain signals about how you work. The signals they look
for are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Do you ask clarifying questions?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Once you are told the technical question, do not immediately start solving
it. Often, the interviewer will intentionally leave out important details and
want you to ask for clarification. It’s important to ask questions for two
reasons: first, it shows that you have a collaborative attitude, and are not
afraid to ask for help. Second, it shows that you are able to work with
vague requirements and can ask the right questions to specify them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Can you accept a hint?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When the interviewer gives you a hint, take it. First, it shows you are able
to adapt to new information and think on your feet. Second, it shows that you
are able to accept help from others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Can you test and debug?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You aren’t finished answering the technical question once you’re done
writing on the whiteboard. You still have to test your program on example
inputs, and debug your program if you find a bug. Before you start thinking
about a solution, I would suggest writing some example test cases on the
whiteboard. Companies love an intern that values testing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Are you aware of time and space complexity?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t wait for the interviewer to ask you about the time complexity of your
program. Once you’re done writing your code and testing your code, offer up
the time and space complexity yourself. This initiative shows that you think
about complexity proactively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-technical-question-follow-up">The Technical Question Follow-Up</h1>

<p>It’s rare to be asked just one technical question in a 45-minute interview.
Either the interviewer will ask you a completely different question, or they
will add a challenge to the original question. Often, the challenge will be a
tighter time-complexity constraint. Often, the time-complexity is a hint to the
solution. If the interviewer tells you it can be solved in linear time, you know
you can’t have nested loops or recursive calls.</p>

<h1 id="what-questions-to-ask-them">What Questions To Ask Them</h1>

<p>The interview will end with a chance for you to ask questions. This is a good
opportunity to show your interest in the company. Research the company
beforehand, learn about what makes them unique, and ask a question about
something you find genuinely interesting about the company. If there’s nothing
about the company you’re curious about, you either didn’t do enough research, or
you’re not that interested anyways.</p>

<h2 id="before-the-interview">Before the Interview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Know your resume. See my <a href="/resume-tips/">previous post</a>
 for resume advice.</li>
  <li>Bring a copy of your resume to the interview.</li>
  <li>Bring spare whiteboard markers, pencils, and paper to the interview.</li>
  <li>Practice questions on a whiteboard, from HackerRank, LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks,
etc.</li>
  <li>Read up on common algorithms and data structures.</li>
  <li>Practice time-complexity and space-complexity analysis.</li>
  <li>Big companies like Google and Facebook are known to value syntactically
correct code. Pick 1 popular language to study (C++, Java, or Python), and learn
to code in it with correct syntax without an IDE.</li>
  <li>Don’t dress up. Don’t follow <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/beyond-ideas/stories/tips-advice/how-dress-for-job-interview">Waterloo’s advice on how to
dress</a>.
You want the interviewer to be able to picture you on the job. Dress how you
would on the actual job. Convey your professionalism with your demeanor, not
your wardrobe.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Interviews are weird. They’re very focused on the technical question. Technical
questions are used to gather signals about you. Make sure you send those
signals, and don’t just answer the question. Research the company so you can ask
them interesting and specific questions at the end. Know your resume, bring
materials to the interview, and don’t dress up.</p>

have to create 6 resumes, and interview with companies 6 times. I’ve reviewed a lot
of resumes over the years and I’ve seen that good resumes follow a certain pattern.</p>

<h1 id="the-resume-is-not-a-summary">The Resume is not a Summary</h1>

<p>The resume is an advertisement highlighting your best relevant qualities, not a summary of everything you’ve done.
Recruiters have to sift through hundreds of resumes, and they don’t have time to
read every one. To save on time, they shortlist a handful of resumes by quickly skimming over them, and they don’t consider the rest.
The hardest part of finding an internship is getting your resume into their shortlist.
Once you’re there, it’s very likely that you’ll get an interview, and if
you get the interview it’s likely you’ll get the job. If a company receives 200
resumes, they will shortlist 30 of them, interview 10 candidates, and give out 5
offers. Make the resume look really good for the snap-judgement phase by
highlighting your best qualities, instead of summarizing all your
accomplishments.</p>

<h1 id="concise-format">Concise Format</h1>

<p>Keep the resume to 1 column and 1 page. 2 columns are difficult to
read, and you don’t have enough experience to span multiple pages.</p>

<p>At the top should be your name, your program and current term number.</p>

<p>Next should be a list of technologies and languages that you know. Recruiters
will often quickly scan through resumes looking for a certain technology, so
having this information right at the top is useful for them. With
technologies/languages, the more you have the better.</p>

<p>Then should be your job experience: past internships, and other tech-related
jobs if you have any. Don’t put unrelated jobs unless you’re looking for your
first internship. Put the company name, job title, the dates you worked there,
and the city. Later on I’ll go into how to best describe your job experience.</p>

<p>After that should be your side projects, which are especially important if you don’t
have a lot of internships under your belt. For your projects, mention what
technologies you used, what it does, when you built it, and any difficult
challenges you had.</p>

<p>Then should be your education, and this is low in your resume since the
recruiter will know you are from Waterloo, and will know what program you’re in
from the application package. This should also include your cumulative average
if it’s above 85%.</p>

<p>Last should be any awards you have from university or high school, particularly,
waterloo CS/math contests.</p>

<p>Do not write about miscellaneous skills, do not list your hobbies, and do not
put an objective. No one makes an employment decision based on hobbies, and if they do, they will ask you about it in
the interview.</p>

<h1 id="writing-about-work-experience">Writing about Work Experience</h1>

<p>Describing your technologies, languages, projects, education, and awards is
pretty straightforward, they are just a list. The content writing comes in when
you’re describing your job experience. I see the same mistakes over and over.</p>

<p>Don’t talk about what you worked on, talk about the impact you had. The first
line (or two) should describe your general job, and every line after that should
be phrased like the following: <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;Impact&gt; by building &lt;x feature&gt; using &lt;y
technology&gt;</code>. For example, you could say <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reduced Messenger background data
usage by 1-2% by building Invertible Bloom Filters for set reconciliation</code>.
Having a numerical metric is awesome, but impact of any kind is great. When
talking about your general job, you can also emphasize how important your team
is by talking about the impact of the team (number of users of product for
example). What I don’t like to see is a long list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Developed x</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Implemented
y</code>, etc. Phrase it so the impact is first in the line, because you should keep
your most important information to the left, and if the reader is still
interested, they will continue reading the line.</p>

<h1 id="tldr">TL;DR</h1>

<p>Keep it to one page, talk about impact instead of a list of everything you
built, include numerical metrics where possible, include keywords (languages,
technologies) as much as possible, and keep the best info to the top-left of the
resume.</p>

<p>While taking Andrew Ng’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning
course</a>, I came across the idea
that neurons in neural networks can simulate logic gates. I wanted to prove this
by manually building a neural network to perform binary addition, and then later
having a neural network learn binary addition via training. This is a really
interesting concept: it shows that there is an equivalence between digital
circuits and neural networks. The neural network is executing on a digital
computer, and it is able to simulate a digital computer. It’s another paradigm
of computing, and the mapping I am about to describe is sound and complete.
Furthermore, biological neurons perform the same function as artifical neurons,
so it also shows an equivalence between digital computers and the brain.</p>

<p>Let’s first take a look at what an individual neuron does:</p>

<p><img src="/images/neuron.png" alt="Neuron" width="500px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>It takes in an array of inputs \(u_0, u_1, u_2\), multiplies each element by its
respective weight, and sums this. If the sum is greater than the threshold
(\(-b_0\)), output 1, otherwise output 0. Formally, the output is</p>

\[y_0 = sigmoid(u_0w_0 + u_1w_1 + u_2w_2 + b_0)\]

<p>where \(sigmoid\) is a smoothed step function outputting 1 if the input is \(&gt;
0\). Using this formula, and restricting the inputs to be 0 or 1, we can build
an AND operator:</p>

<p><img src="/images/and.png" alt="Neuron" width="500px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>If both inputs are 0, the sum will be -1.5 so the neuron will not activate. If
only 1 input is 1, the sum will be -0.5 so the neuron will not activate. If both
inputs are 1, the sum will be 0.5 so the neuron will activate. Similarly, we can build an OR operator:</p>

<p><img src="/images/or.png" alt="Neuron" width="500px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>We can also build a NOT operator:</p>

<p><img src="/images/not.png" alt="Neuron" width="500px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>Using these 3 basic logic gates, we can build more complicated gates such as
XOR. We can simplify the XOR gate by realizing that \(A\ XOR\ B\) is the same as \((A\ OR\ B)\ AND\ NOT\ (A\ AND\ B)\):</p>

<p><img src="/images/xor.png" alt="Neuron" width="500px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>Now that we have the basic conversions from logic gates to neurons, let’s look
at the logic circuit for a 2-bit binary adder:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adder_circuit.png" alt="Neuron" width="600px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>The first output is calculated by XORing the 2 least-significant bits. There is
a carry-over only if the first bits are both 1. Translating each logic gate into
neurons, the neural network for the binary adder should look like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adder_network.png" alt="Neuron" width="600px" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>This network takes in 4 inputs (2 bits for input a, 2 bits for input b), and
outputs 3 bits, since adding 2 bit numbers can result in 3 bits (ex. 3 + 3 = 6,
so 11 + 11 = 110). There are 2 hidden layers: the first hidden layer has 6
neurons, and the second hidden layer has 4 neurons. Going from left to right,
the layers are of size: 4,6,4,5,3.</p>

<p>We can manually test this network we have built on some inputs and see that it
works. Now, let’s use Tensorflow and automatically train a neural network of the
same shape to learn binary addition!</p>

<p>We’ll start by importing Tensorflow, and setting the size of the input layer,
the 3 intermediate layers, and the output layer:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tensorflow</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">tf</span>

<span class="n">input_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">hidden_1_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="n">hidden_2_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">hidden_3_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="n">output_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The Tensorflow python library is mostly just an interface to the main C++
backend which runs in a separate process. In order to communicate with the C++
backend, we need to specify shared data in the form of tf Variables. The input
(the 2 2-bit numbers) will be one variable (a vector of size 4), the output will be another (a vector of size 3), and the
weights and biases of the network will also be variables. We will specify the
weights as matrices.</p>

<p>Recently I visited Blue Mountain, and I wanted to see if I could avoid paying $15 per day per device for internet access. Once you connect to their network, they present 3 options to purchase internet access:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter your credit card information and get billed directly.</li>
  <li>Enter your room number and name and have the charge applied to your room.</li>
  <li>Enter an authorization code.</li>
</ol>

<p>I pursued option 3, and decided to crack an authorization code through brute-force. I looked through the html/javascript and found that it wasn’t minified, so it was easy to see the logic. The submit button triggers a javascript function that uses JQuery to get the value of the auth code field, and it makes an HTTP GET request where the auth code is a query parameter. The result is a JSON object, and if the property “status” is 2, then it is a valid auth code. This endpoint was very fast, and didn’t have any special encoding or security measurements in place. On the website it said that authorization codes are case insensitive, and I made the assumption that they were alphanumeric.</p>

<p>I wrote a python script to try all alphanumeric auth codes of length 4 and let it run for about 30 minutes. This was a multithreaded script using 200 threads, making a total of 1.7 million requests. The script stumbled upon <code class="highlighter-rouge">ends</code>, which turned out to be an authorization code that employees of Blue Mountain share to get internet access. I entered this code into the landing page and it worked. Free internet access after a half-hour of password cracking.</p>

I was immersed for 8 hours a day in industrial quality Android programming. It was an Agile environment, with strong emphasis on Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, Continuous Integration, and fast iterations.</p>

<h2 id="orientation">Orientation</h2>

<p>On the first day we learned how Xtreme Labs became Pivotal Labs, and then how Pivotal Labs was a part of a larger organization, Pivotal. For our first week, we weren’t assigned to any project. We were told to create an app on a platform of our choice, which consumes a REST API. The app must display information in a list format, and load it asynchronously. As a bonus, we have to persist the data. I chose to learn iOS, but after 3 days, I finished my basic app and got bored, so I made another one in Android. We also had to test our app using a framework made by Pivotal. These include, Robolectric (Android), Cedar (iOS), and Jasmine (Javascript).</p>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<h3 id="lunch-and-learns">Lunch and Learns</h3>
<p>Every Tuesday the company had a Lunch and Learn, where lunch was catered and a speaker was invited to talk to us about a relevant topic. These talks were a mixture of technical and business. Some topics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Money management</li>
  <li>How to market your app</li>
  <li>TDD with Robolectric</li>
  <li>MVVM on Android</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h3>
<p>Every developer at Pivotal Labs works at a pairing station. Each pairing station has one computer, two duplicate monitors, two keyboards, and two mice. At any given time, only one person can control the computer. This allows for a constant code review by the person who isn’t typing. At first, it’s difficult to grasp the idea that you are not in control of your computer. At the beginning, it frustrated me too. Later on, you become so used to it that it’s hard to code without someone there to tell you you’re on the right path. Code quality significantly increases since every line has been written with at least two pairs of eyes on it. Finally, pair programming increases productivity despite the fact that only 1 out of 2 people can type. There’s no time to screw around when someone is always there watching your screen.</p>

<h2 id="the-tools">The Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pivotal Tracker</strong>, our story management tool.</li>
  <li><strong>Robolectric</strong>, an Android testing framework developed by Pivotal Labs.</li>
  <li><strong>Travis CI</strong> for continuous integration.</li>
  <li><strong>Android Studio</strong> for our Android IDE.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-process">Application Process</h2>

<p>The process started with a written test, which consisted of only 3 questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given a staircase with <strong>n</strong> number of steps. With each stride you take,
you can either cover 1 step, or 2 steps. How many different ways can you climb the staircase?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Determine whether two rectangles are intersecting. (You are given the coordinates of all vertices of the rectangles)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What notable projects have you worked on in the past?</p>
</blockquote>
